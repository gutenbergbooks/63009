<p><i>Mr. Reviewer and My Dear Readers,</i></p></div>


<p>I have been asked to say a few
words to you before you get busy with
my little book that is filled with
&#8220;Cheerful Americans&#8221; going out for
automobile rides.</p>

<p>A generation or two ago, there was
a poor writer (I mean poor in this
world&#8217;s goods, of course) and he saw
people riding about in automobiles as
if they owned them, and it made him
wish he could ride about in one as
if he owned it. But he lacked the
nerve, so he had to be content with
trolleys.</p>

<p>After a while he made believe that
he had bought an automobile, and he
rode around in it with &#8220;Araminta,&#8221;
and enjoyed the motion so much that
he set others to riding in automobiles
that he made himself in his study, and
he was much pleased at the way they
&#8220;went.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while he made a collection
of these stories and they went some
more, and now they are off for a cross
country trip that will undoubtedly
result in the critics saying of the writer,
&#8220;He has the pen of a Charles Dickens;&#8221;
or &#8220;he reminds one of Robert
Louis Stevenson at his best;&#8221; or &#8220;he
succeeds, as no man since Sir Walter
Scott has succeeded, in writing automobile
stories that cause the helpless
and fascinated reader to sit up all
night regardless of anything save the
flight of the machine;&#8221; or perhaps
they will say &#8220;the mantle of Bret Harte
has fallen upon him, and with the
possible exception of Nathaniel Hawthorne
no one has written such tales
of the clutch and brake and sparker.&#8221;</p>

<p>Readers, need I tell you who that
poor writer was? The poor boy who
in 1865 had never even seen an automobile
stands before you, and his
name is</p>

<p><span class="xlarge"><span class="smcap">Some</span></span> persons spend their surplus
on works of art; some spend it on
Italian gardens and pergolas; there
are those who sink it in golf, and I
have heard of those who expended
it on charity.</p>

<p>None of these forms of getting
away with money appealed to Araminta
and myself. As soon as it
was ascertained that the automobile
was practicable and would not cost
a king&#8217;s ransom, I determined to
devote my savings to the purchase
of one.</p>

<p>Araminta and I live in a suburban
town; she because she loves
Nature, and I because I love Araminta.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
We have been married for
five years.</p>

<p>I am a bank clerk in New York,
and morning and night I go through
the monotony of railway travel, and
for one who is forbidden to use his
eyes on the train and who does not
play cards it <i>is</i> monotony, for in
the morning my friends are either
playing cards or else reading their
papers, and one does not like to
urge the claims of conversation on
one who is deep in politics or the
next play of his antagonist; so my
getting to business and coming back
are in the nature of purgatory. I
therefore hailed the automobile as a
Heaven-sent means of swift motion
with an agreeable companion, and
with no danger of encountering
either newspapers or cards. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
seen neither reading nor card-playing
going on in any automobile.</p>

<p>The community in which I live
is not progressive, and when I said
that I expected to buy an automobile
as soon as my ship came in I was
frowned upon by my neighbors.
Several of them have horses, and
all, or nearly all, have feet. The
horsemen were not more opposed
to my proposed ownership than the
footmen&mdash;I should say pedestrians.
They all thought automobiles dangerous
and a menace to public
peace, but of course I pooh-poohed
their fears and, being a person of a
good deal of stability of purpose, I
went on saving my money, and in
course of time I bought an automobile
of the electric sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;Young man, experience teaches more in half an hour than<br />
books or precepts do in a year&#8221;</p>

<p>Araminta is plucky, and I am
perfectly fearless. When the automobile
was brought home and
housed in the little barn that is on
our property, the man who had
backed it in told me that he had
orders to stay and show me how it
worked, but I laughed at him&mdash;good-naturedly
yet firmly. I said,
&#8220;Young man, experience teaches
more in half an hour than books or
precepts do in a year. A would-be
newspaper man does not go to a
school of journalism if he is wise;
he gets a position on a newspaper
and learns for himself, and through
his mistakes. I know that one of
these levers is to steer by, that another
lets loose the power, and
that there is a foot-brake. I also
know that the machine is charged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and I need to know no more.
Good-day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus did I speak to the young
man, and he saw that I was a
person of force and discretion, and
he withdrew to the train and I
never saw him again.</p>

<p>Araminta had been to Passaic
shopping, but she came back while
I was out in the barn looking at
my new purchase, and she joined
me there. I looked at her lovingly,
and she returned the look.
Our joint ambition was realized;
we were the owners of an automobile,
and we were going out that
afternoon.</p>

<p>Why is it that cheap barns are
so flimsily built? I know that our
barn is cheap because the rent for
house and barn is less than what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
many a clerk, city pent, pays for
a cramped flat; but again I ask,
why are they flimsily built? I have
no complaint to make. If my barn
had been built of good stout oak I
might to-day be in a hospital.</p>

<p>It happened this way. Araminta
said, &#8220;Let me get in, and we will
take just a little ride to see how it
goes,&#8221; and I out of my love for
her said, &#8220;Wait just a few minutes,
dearest, until I get the hang
of the thing. I want to see how
much go she has and just how she
works.&#8221;</p>

<p>Araminta has learned to obey
my slightest word, knowing that
love is at the bottom of all my
commands, and she stepped to one
side while I entered the gayly painted
vehicle and tried to move out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the barn. I moved out. But I
backed. Oh, blessed, cheaply built
barn. My way was not restricted
to any appreciable extent. I shot
gayly through the barn into the hen
yard, and the sound of the ripping
clapboards frightened the silly hens
who were enjoying a dust-bath, and
they fled in more directions than
there were fowls.</p>

<p>I had not intended entering the
hen yard, and I did not wish to
stay there, so I kept on out, the
wire netting not being what an automobile
would call an obstruction.
I never lose my head, and when I
heard Araminta screaming in the
barn, I called out cheerily to her,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a minute, dear,
but I&#8217;m coming another way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And I did come another way. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
came all sorts of ways. I really
don&#8217;t know what got into the machine,
but she now turned to the
left and made for the road, and then
she ran along on her two left
wheels for a moment, and then
seemed about to turn a somersault,
but changed her mind, and, still
veering to the left, kept on up the
road, passing my house at a furious
speed, and making for the open
country. With as much calmness
as I could summon I steered her,
but I think I steered her a little too
much, for she turned toward my
house.</p>

<p>I reached one end of the front
piazza at the same time that Araminta
reached the other end of it.
I had the right of way, and she deferred
to me just in time. I removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the vestibule storm door. It
was late in March, and I did not
think we should have any more
use for it that season. And we
didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I had ordered a strongly built
machine, and I was now glad of it,
because a light and weak affair that
was merely meant to run along on
a level and unobstructed road would
not have stood the assault on my
piazza. Why, my piazza did not
stand it. It caved in, and made
work for an already overworked
local carpenter who was behind-hand
with his orders. After I had
passed through the vestibule, I applied
the brake and it worked. The
path is not a cinder one, as I think
them untidy, so I was not more
than muddied. I was up in an instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and looked at the still enthusiastic
machine with admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got the hang of it?&#8221;
said Araminta.</p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s one thing I like about
Araminta. She does not waste
words over non-essentials. The
point was not that I had damaged
the piazza. I needed a new one,
anyway. The main thing was that
I was trying to get the hang of the
machine, and she recognized that
fact instantly.</p>

<p>I told her that I thought I had,
and that if I had pushed the lever
in the right way at first, I should
have come out of the barn in a more
conventional way.</p>

<p>She again asked me to let her
ride, and as I now felt that I
could better cope with the curves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the machine I allowed her to
get in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lose your head,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t,&#8221; said she,
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you have occasion to
leave me, drop over the back. Never
jump ahead. That is a fundamental
rule in runaways of all kinds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then we started, and I ran the
motor along for upward of half a
mile after I had reached the highway,
which I did by a short cut
through a field at the side of our
house. There is only a slight rail
fence surrounding it, and my machine
made little of that. It really
seemed to delight in what some
people would have called danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Araminta, are you glad that I
saved up for this?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;I am mad with joy,&#8221; said the
dear thing, her face flushed with
excitement mixed with expectancy.
Nor were her expectations to be
disappointed. We still had a good
deal to do before we should have
ended our first ride.</p>

<p>So far I had damaged property
to a certain extent, but I had no
one but myself to reckon with, and
I was providing work for people.
I always have claimed that he who
makes work for two men where
there was only work for one before,
is a public benefactor, and that
day I was the friend of carpenters
and other mechanics.</p>

<p>Along the highway we flew, our
hearts beating high, but never in
our mouths, and at last we saw a
team approaching us. By &#8220;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
team&#8221; I mean a horse and buggy.
I was raised in Connecticut, where
a team is anything you choose to
call one.</p>

<p>The teamster saw us. Well, perhaps
I should not call him a teamster
(although he was one logically):
he was our doctor, and, as I say, he
saw us.</p>

<p>Now I think it would have been
friendly in him, seeing that I was
more or less of a novice at the art
of automobiling, to have turned to
the left when he saw that I was
inadvertently turning to the left,
but the practice of forty years added
to a certain native obstinacy made
him turn to the right, and he met
me at the same time that I met
him.</p>

<p>The horse was not hurt, for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I am truly glad, and the doctor
joined us, and continued with us
for a season, but his buggy was
demolished.</p>

<p>Of course I am always prepared
to pay for my pleasure, and though
it was not, strictly speaking, my
pleasure to deprive my physician
of his turn-out, yet if he <i>had</i> turned
out it wouldn&#8217;t have happened&mdash;and,
as I say, I was prepared to get
him a new vehicle. But he was
very unreasonable; so much so
that, as he was crowding us&mdash;for
the seat was not built for more than
two, and he is stout&mdash;I at last told
him that I intended to turn around
and carry him home, as we were
out for pleasure, and he was giving
us pain.</p>

<p>I will confess that the events of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the last few minutes had rattled
me somewhat, and I did not feel
like turning just then, as the road
was narrow. I knew that the road
turned of its own accord a half-mile
farther on, and so I determined
to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to get out,&#8221; said the
doctor tartly, and just as he said
so Araminta stepped on the brake,
accidentally. The doctor got out&mdash;in
front. With great presence
of mind I reversed, and so we did
not run over him. But he was
furious and sulphurous, and that
is why I have changed to homeopathy.
He was the only allopathic
doctor in Brantford.</p>

<p>I suppose that if I had stopped
and apologized, he would have made
up with me, and I would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
got angry with him; but I couldn&#8217;t
stop. The machine was now going
as she had done when I left
the barn, and we were backing into
town.</p>

<p>Through it all I did not lose my
coolness. I said: &#8220;Araminta, look
out behind, which is ahead for us,
and if you have occasion to jump
now, do it in front, which is behind,&#8221;
and Araminta understood
me.</p>

<p>She sat sideways, so that she
could see what was going on, but
that might have been seen from
any point of view, for we were
the only things going on&mdash;or
backing.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we passed the wreck
of the buggy, and then we saw the
horse grazing on dead grass by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
roadside, and at last we came on a
few of our townfolk who had seen
us start, and were now come out to
welcome us home. But I did not
go home just then. I should have
done so if the machine had minded
me and turned in at our driveway,
but it did not.</p>

<p>Across the way from us there is
a fine lawn leading up to a beautiful
greenhouse full of rare orchids
and other plants. It is the pride
of my very good neighbor, Jacob
Rawlinson.</p>

<p>The machine, as if moved by
<i>malice prepense</i>, turned just as we
came to the lawn, and began to
back at railroad speed.</p>

<p>I told Araminta that if she was
tired of riding, now was the best
time to stop; that she ought not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
overdo it, and that I was going to
get out myself as soon as I had seen
her off.</p>

<p>I saw her off.</p>

<p>Then after one ineffectual jab at
the brake, I left the machine hurriedly,
and as I sat down on the
sposhy lawn I heard a tremendous
but not unmusical sound of falling
glass....</p>

<p>I tell Araminta that it isn&#8217;t the
running of an automobile that is
expensive. It is the stopping of
it.</p>

<small>THE DECEPTION OF</small><br />

MARTHA TUCKER<br />

<small>AN AUTOMOBILE EXTRAVAGANZA</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="xxlarge"><span class="smcap">It</span></span> was not that Martha Tucker
was particularly fond of horses
so much as that she was afraid of
automobiles of every sort, kind,
or description. That was why she
said that she would never consent
to her husband&#8217;s purchasing a motor
carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses were good enough for
my father, and I guess that horses
will do for me as long as I live and
John is able to keep them,&#8221; said
she to various friends on numerous
occasions.</p>

<p>But if she was ridiculously old-fashioned
in her notions, John was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
not, and he cast about in his mind
for some way to circumvent Martha
without her knowing it. The thing
would have been easy to do if it
had not been for the fact that they
were a very loving couple. John
seldom went anywhere without
taking his wife along, and as his
business was of such a nature that
he carried it on under his roof-tree,
he was unable to speed along in
happy loneliness on a locomobile or
electric motor. Besides all this,
John Tucker&#8217;s conscience was such
a peculiar affair that if he hoodwinked
Martha it must be in her
sight.</p>

<p>The Tuckers always spent their
summers at Arlinberg, the roads
around which were famous for
driving; and almost their only out-door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
recreation, aside from wandering
afoot in the fields, was found in
riding behind any one or two of
his half-dozen horses. The fact
that he was abundantly able to
maintain the most expensive automobile
extant made it doubly hard
for John to abstain from the use
of one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave up smoking to please
Martha when we first married, but
I do not intend to give up the idea
of running an automobile of my
own, just because she has the
old-fogy notions of the Hiltons in
her blood. Her father never rode
in a steam-car, although the road
passed by his back door, and all
the Hiltons are old-fogyish&mdash;which
sums up their faults.&#8221;</p>

<p>John said this to an old school-mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
who was spending a Sunday
at his house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t she try one of your
neighbor&#8217;s automobiles, and see how
she likes it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; her no is a no. But
I mean to ride in one with her
sometime, if I have to blindfold her
and tell her it&#8217;s a baby-carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may have been a week after
this conversation that John and
Martha wandered in the woods
picking wild flowers, and Mrs.
Tucker was inoculated with ivy-poisoning
that settled in her eyes,
so that for several days she was
confined to her room, and when
she came out she was told by her
doctor to wear smoked glasses for
a week or two, her eyes still being
inflamed and very painful. &#8220;Keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
outdoors; go riding as much as
you can, but don&#8217;t take off the
glasses until the inflammation has
entirely subsided,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>John was sincerely sorry for his
wife&#8217;s misfortune, but when he
heard that she would see through
a glass darkly for the matter of a
week or two, he made up his mind
to act and act quickly.</p>

<p>They went out for a ride that he
might test her vision. The horse
he was driving was a gray, Roanoke
by name.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mr. Tucker,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think that the gait of
this black horse is very like that of
Roanoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said
Martha. &#8220;With these dismal
glasses on I&#8217;m not quite sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
whether it&#8217;s a horse or a cow in
the harness. I get a hazy outline
of some animal, but no
color and little form. Don&#8217;t ever
touch poison-ivy if you value your
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the doctor says you&#8217;ll
be all right in a week or two. By
the way, Martha, I&#8217;m going to run
down to New York to-morrow on
business. I&#8217;ll be back in the
evening. If your eyes were all
right you might come along, but
as it is, I guess you&#8217;d better not go
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; driving around with James
will do me more good than a stuffy
train. Come home as soon as you
can, dear, and&mdash;&#8221; She hesitated.
&#8220;I hate the old things, but if you
are so set on trying one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
automobiles, why don&#8217;t you do it
to-morrow, when you are in New
York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I believe I will, my dear.
I wish I could overcome your prejudice
against them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t, dear, so don&#8217;t
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mr. Tucker reached New
York, the first thing that he did was
to visit an automobile repository.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be possible for you
to let me have an automobile that
could be operated from behind, so
that my wife and I could sit in front
and simply enjoy the ride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly,&#8221; said the man.
&#8220;We have every style known to
the most advanced makers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And could I have shafts attached
to it, so that if it broke down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I could call in the services of some
horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir, our machines never
break down. That is why we
are selling one every minute in
the working-day. Our agents are
located in every known city of
the earth, and our factories are
running day and night, and in
spite of it we are falling behind in
our orders in a rapidly increasing
ratio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Mr. Tucker,
turning to leave the store. &#8220;Then
I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to go elsewhere,
as I wanted one shipped to me to-morrow
or next day. A birthday
present for my wife, you understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose,&#8221; said the wily
salesman, &#8220;that I <i>could</i> let you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ahead of your turn if the payment
were cash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course the payment will be
cash. That&#8217;s the only way I ever
pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-hour from that time
John Tucker was being propelled
through New York&#8217;s busy streets in
a smoothly running, almost noiseless,
automobile worked from
behind, and its way led down to
a harness store in Chambers Street.
As yet there were no shafts, but he
had provided for a pair.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker went into the harness-store.
&#8220;Good-day,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I want to buy a wooden horse
like the one out in front, only covered
with horse-skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said the clerk,
&#8220;we don&#8217;t manufacture them ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but we can order one for you.
Going into the harness business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I want to try an experiment.
Would it be possible
for me to have a mechanical horse
built that would move its legs in a
passable imitation of trotting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowadays everything is possible,&#8221;
said the salesman; &#8220;but it
would be very expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you just what I
want it for,&#8221; said Mr. Tucker, and
entered into details concerning Mrs.
Tucker&#8217;s aversion to automobiles,
her ivy-poisoning, and his scheme.
The clerk seemed interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the lady&#8217;s eyes are as inflamed
as all that,&#8221; said he, &#8220;she
would not notice the lack of natural
motion, and it would be easy to
place a contrivance inside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
figure that would imitate the sound
of trotting, and your wife&#8217;s imagination
would do the rest. But I
think that your idea of having the
horse on a platform like the one
out front is not a good one. If the
platform struck a rock in the road
it would knock the whole thing to
smithereens. Better place smallish
wheels on the inner side of the
ankles, fix the hind legs so they
will be jointed at the thighs, and
then you can run up hill and down
dale with no trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker clapped his hands
like a boy. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine! My
wife will get thoroughly used to an
automobile without knowing she is
riding in one, and then when she
recovers the use of her eyes I&#8217;ll
give the wooden horse a well-earned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
rest. Call up that factory
on the &#8217;phone, and I&#8217;ll order my
hobby-horse at once. You think
that I can get it in a day or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a question of expense,
sir, and you say that is nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;s nothing. Nothing
is anything if I can take my
wife out automobiling without her
knowing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three days later Mr. Tucker
said to his wife at luncheon:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, as this is your birthday,
I have given myself the pleasure
of buying you a new horse and
wagon, and it will be ready for us
to go out in half an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear, thoughtful
man!&#8221; said Mrs. Tucker, beaming as
well as she was able to through her
smoked glasses. Then she rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and gave him a kiss that made him
feel that he was a guilty wretch to
be meditating the deception of such
a lovable wife. But he had gone
too far to retrace his steps now,
and he eased his feelings with the
thought that the end would
justify the means.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always doing things to
please me,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;No such thing,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;You may not like this horse as
well as you like Roanoke or Charley,
but it is quite a swagger turn-out,
and I&#8217;ve decided to have James
go with us and sit behind on the
rumble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but, my dear, we will
not be driving alone if he is with
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! We&#8217;ve been married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
twenty years, and anyhow
James is a graven image. He
will not know we are along.&#8221;
(&#8220;He will be too busy running
the thing,&#8221; added Mr. Tucker
mentally.)</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">She approached the horse&#8217;s head to pet him</p>

<p>A half-hour later Mr. Tucker announced
to his wife that he was
ready, and she put a few finishing
touches to her toilet, bathed her
eyes with witch-hazel, adjusted her
smoked glasses, and went out to
the porte-cochère.</p>



<p>She dimly discerned the horse,
the wagon, the groom at the horse&#8217;s
head, and her husband. There
was an indescribably swagger look
about the equipage, and she wished
that she could take off her glasses
and gloat over her new possession,
but the doctor&#8217;s orders had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
imperative. She did, however, approach
the horse&#8217;s head to pet him,
but her husband said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t,
dear. He may not like women.
Wait until he is used to us before
you try to coddle him.&#8221;</p>



<p>They stepped to their seats; the
groom left the horse&#8217;s head and
handed the reins to Mr. Tucker,
mounted the rumble, and off they
started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s like sailing,&#8221; said
Mrs. Tucker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pneumatic tires, my dear,&#8221;
answered her husband glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how rhythmical the horse&#8217;s
hoof-beats are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An evidence of blood, my darling.
I know this horse&#8217;s pedigree:
by Carpenter out of Chestnut&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t. I never cared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
those long genealogies. Whether
he has blood or not, he is certainly
the smoothest traveller I
ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had been skilfully guided
along the winding path that led to
the highway by the chauffeur, who,
although he was a James, was not
the James who generally worked
in the stable, but a James hired at
the office of the company in order
that he might break in the <i>local</i>
James.</p>

<p>After they reached the road the
way for a mile or more was clear
and straight, and they met with no
teams. The horse was wonderfully
lifelike, except in his action,
or rather lack of action, for his
forefeet were eternally in an attitude
of rest. The hind legs rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and fell with the inequalities of the
road, and his mane and tail waved
in the breeze like the real horsehair
that they were.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the poetry of motion,&#8221;
said Mrs. Tucker. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
you&#8217;ll ever find an automobile
that can run like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that I wouldn&#8217;t wish
one to go better. Are you all right
back there, James?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how queer James&#8217; voice
sounds! I never noticed that squeak
in it before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the exhilarating effect of
our fast driving. Do you think
that you could stand a faster pace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, if you&#8217;re not afraid of
tiring the horse. He seems to be
going like the wind now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, he won&#8217;t mind. Faster,
James.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that to James?
Did you think <i>he</i> was driving, you
absent-minded dear, you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, for the moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>James was <i>sure</i> he was driving,
and at this command from his employer
he put on almost the full
force of the electricity. The wagon
gave a leap forward, and turning
into a macadamized road at this
point, they went along at the rate
of twenty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tucker clutched her husband&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;John, his speed is
uncanny. We seem to be going
like an express-train!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the smoothness of the road
and his perfect breeding, my dear.
Do you notice that this furious gait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
does not seem to affect his wind at
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hadn&#8217;t noticed it; but
isn&#8217;t it queer how regular his hoof-beats
are? and they do not seem to
quicken their rate at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>John had noticed this, too, and
he had regretted not having told
the manufacturer to arrange the
mechanism so that the hoof-beats
would become more or less rapid
according to the gait; but he answered
quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;That, my dear, is because he
reaches farther and farther. You
know some breeds of horses gain
speed by quickening their gait. This
horse gains it by a lengthened reach.
He is a remarkable animal. Actually,
my dear, we are overtaking a
locomobile.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, John, is he used to these
horrid steam-wagons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will frighten this horse,
Martha. You can rest assured of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later they passed the
locomobile. If Mrs. Tucker could
have seen the codfish eyes of the
occupant of the vehicle when he
saw a hobby-horse going by at the
rate of twenty miles an hour, she
would have questioned his sanity.
If she could have seen the scared
looks and the scared horse of the
people in the approaching buggy
she would have begun to wonder
what possessed her new possession.
But her goggles saved her from
present worry, and the buggy was
passed in a flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do wish I could take off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
my glasses for a minute so that I
could enjoy this rapid motion to the
full! How the trees must be spinning
by!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch your glasses,&#8221;
said Mr. Tucker, hurriedly. &#8220;If a
speck of dust or a pebble were to
get into your eye, you might become
permanently blind. Positively,
you are like a child with a
new rocking-horse. This turn-out
will keep until your eyes are fully
recovered, and I hope we may
enjoy many a spin in this easy
carriage, with or without this
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never without him, dear.
After the delight of this swift
motion I never would go back to
lazy Roanoke or skittish Charley.
I have never ridden in any carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
that pleased me like this
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a convert already without
knowing it,&#8221; said her husband
to himself, but her next remark
dispelled his illusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can any one like a noisy
automobile better than this? You
can&#8217;t improve on nature. By the
way, I forgot to ask you if you
rode in one the other day in New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. I <i>didn&#8217;t</i> tell you,
did I? It was really almost as nice
as this, although the traffic impeded
us some. Oh, James, look
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>This interruption was involuntary
on the part of Mr. Tucker, and
his words were not noticed by his
wife in the confusion of that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
followed. They were going down
a hill at a fearful rate, when the off
foreleg of the wooden horse became
a veritable off foreleg, for it
hit a log of wood that had dropped
from a teamster&#8217;s cart not five minutes
before, and broke off at the
knee. The jar almost threw Mrs.
Tucker out; she grasped the dashboard
to save herself, and caught a
momentary glimpse of the oddly
working haunches of the imitation
beast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, John, he&#8217;s running
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, this was not quite accurate,
for he was being pushed
away by a runaway automobile.
Mr. Tucker noticed the increased
speed and turned to admonish
James.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>James had left.</p>

<p>The departure of James was coincident
with the collision, and he
was at that moment extricating
himself from a sapling into which
he had been pitched. He yelled
directions to Mr. Tucker which
lacked carrying power.</p>

<p>The vehicle had now come to a
turn in the road, and not receiving
any impulse to the contrary, it
made for a stone wall that lay before
it. Mr. Tucker knew nothing
about the working of the machine,
but with admirable presence of
mind he seized a projecting rod,
and the wagon turned to the left
with prompt obedience, but so suddenly
that it ran upon two wheels
and nearly upset.</p>

<p>So far so good, but now what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
should he do? To get over to the
back seat was either to give the
whole thing away, or else make
Mrs. Tucker question his courage.</p>

<p>He was too obstinate to disclose
his secret until he should be forced
to, so he sat still and awaited developments.
Developments do not
keep you waiting long when you
are in a runaway automobile, and
in just one minute by his watch,
although he did not time it, the
end came.</p>

<p>Too late to do any good, John
Tucker jumped over the back of
the seat, because he saw the wooden
horse again approaching a stonewall
beyond which lay a frog pond.</p>

<p>He pulled the lever as before,
but he could not have pulled it
hard enough, for the next moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
there was a shock, and then Mrs.
Tucker sailed like a sprite through
the air and landed in the water
like a nymph, while some kindling
wood in a horsehair skin was
all that was left of Mr. Tucker&#8217;s
thoroughbred.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker was not hurt by the
impact, for he had grasped an overhanging
bough and saved himself.
He dropped to earth, vaulted a
stone wall, and rescued the fainting
figure of his wife. The kindly
services of a farmer procured her
the shelter of a neighboring farm-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Tucker knew from past experiences
that his wife was an easy
fainter, and after assuring himself
that no bones were broken he left
her for a few minutes that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
run out to seek for James, who
might be at death&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>He found him gazing upon the
ruins of the wooden horse.</p>

<p>Upon learning that the man was
uninjured he drew a bill from his
pocket and said: &#8220;My boy, here&#8217;s
money for your expenses and your
wages, and if there is any go in
this machine, run her to New York
and tell your people that they can
have her as a gift. I am through
with automobiles.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a half-hour later Mrs.
Tucker, fully conscious but somewhat
weak, sat up on the bed in the
farmer&#8217;s best chamber and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;John, I think that if it had
been a horseless automobile it
wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon John overtook James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
just setting out for New York, and
gave him an order for one horseless
automobile.</p>

<p>And now John is convinced that
his wife is a thoroughbred.</p>

<small>A CHRISTMAS EXTRAVAGANZA</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="xxlarge"><span class="smcap">It</span></span> was a letter to encourage
a hesitating lover, and certainly
Orville Thornton, author of
&#8220;Thoughts for Non-Thinkers,&#8221;
came under that head. He received
it on a Tuesday, and immediately
made up his mind to
declare his intentions to Miss
Annette Badeau that evening.</p>

<p>But perhaps the contents of the
letter will help the reader to a better
understanding of the case.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Orville</span>: Miss Badeau sails
unexpectedly for Paris on the day
after Christmas, her aunt Madge having
cabled her to come and visit her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Won&#8217;t you come to Christmas dinner?
I&#8217;ve invited the Joe Burtons, and of
course Mr. Marten will be there, but
no others&mdash;except Miss Badeau.</p>

<p>Dinner will be at sharp seven.
Don&#8217;t be late, although I know you
won&#8217;t, you human time-table.</p>

<p>I do hope that Annette will not
fall in love in Paris. I wish that she
would marry some nice New Yorker
and settle near me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that you have
neglected marriage shamefully.</p>

<p>Remember to-morrow night, and
Annette sails on Thursday. Wishing
you a Merry Christmas, I am,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">Your old friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Henrietta Marten</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Annette Badeau had come across
the line of Orville&#8217;s vision three
months before. She was Mrs.
Marten&#8217;s niece, and had come from
the West to live with her aunt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
just about the time that the success
of Thornton&#8217;s book made him
think of marriage.</p>

<p>She was pretty and bright and
expansive in a Western way, and
when Thornton met her at one of
the few afternoon teas that he ever
attended he fell in love with her.
When he learned that she was the
niece of his lifelong friend, Mrs.
Marten, he suddenly discovered
various reasons why he should call
at the Marten house once or twice
a week.</p>

<p>But a strange habit he had of
putting off delightful moments in
order to enjoy anticipation to its
fullest extent had caused him to refrain
from disclosing the state of
his heart to Miss Badeau, and so
that young woman, who had fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in love with him even before she
knew that he was the gifted author
of &#8220;Thoughts for Non-Thinkers,&#8221;
often wished to herself that she
could in some way give him a hint
of the state of <i>her</i> heart.</p>

<p>Orville received Mrs. Marten&#8217;s
letter on Christmas Eve, and its
contents made him plan a schedule
for the next evening&#8217;s running. No
power on earth could keep him
away from that dinner, and he immediately
sent a telegram of regret
to the Bell-wether of the Wolves&#8217;
Club, although he had been anticipating
the Christmas gorge for a
month.</p>

<p>He also sent a messenger with
a note of acceptance to Mrs.
Marten....</p>

<p>Then he joined the crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
persons who always wait until
Christmas Eve before buying the
presents that stern and unpleasant
duty makes it necessary to get.</p>

<p>It would impart a characteristic
Christmas flavor if it were possible
to cover the ground with snow,
and to make the air merry with the
sound of flashing belts of silvery
sleighbells on prancing horses; but
although Christmases in stories are
always snowy and frosty and sparkling
with ice-crystals, Christmases
in real life are apt to be damp and
humid. Let us be thankful that
this Christmas was merely such a
one as would not give a ghost of a
reason for a trip to Florida. The
mercury stood at 58, and even
light overcoats were not things to
be put on without thought.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>Orville knew what he wished to
get and where it was sold, and so
he had an advantage over ninety-nine
out of a hundred of the
anxious-looking shoppers who were
scuttling from shop to shop, burdened
with bundles, and making
the evening the worst in the year
for tired sales-girls and -men.</p>

<p>Orville&#8217;s present was not exactly
Christmassy, but he hoped that
Miss Badeau would like it, and it
was certainly the finest one on the
velvet tray. Orville, it will be seen,
was of a sanguine disposition.</p>

<p>He did not hang up his stocking;
he had not done that for several
years; but he did dream that
Santa Claus brought him a beautiful
doll from Paris, and just as he
was saying, &#8220;There must be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
mistake,&#8221; the doll turned into Miss
Badeau and said: &#8220;No, I&#8217;m for
you. Merry Christmas!&#8221; Then
he woke up and thought how foolish
and yet how fascinating dreams
are.</p>

<p>Christmas morning was spent in
polishing up an old essay on &#8220;The
Value of the Summer as an Invigorator.&#8221;
It had long been a habit
of his to work over old stuff on his
holidays, and if he was about to
marry he would need to sell everything
he had&mdash;of a literary-marketable
nature. But this
morning a vision of a lovely girl
who on the morrow was going to
sail thousands of miles away came
between him and the page, and at
last he tossed the manuscript into
a drawer and went out for a walk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>It was the draggiest Christmas
he had ever known, and the warmest.
He dropped in at the club, but
there was hardly any one there;
still, he did manage to play a few
games of billiards, and at last
the clock announced that it was
time to go home and dress for the
Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>It was half-past live when he left
the club. It was twenty minutes
to six when he slipped on a piece
of orange-peel, and measured his
length on the sidewalk. He was
able to rise and hobble up the steps
on one foot, but the hall-boy had to
help him to the elevator and thence
to his room. He dropped upon
his bed, feeling white about the
gills.</p>

<p>Orville was a most methodical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
man. He planned his doings days
ahead and seldom changed his
schedule. But it seemed likely
that unless he was built of sterner
stuff than most of the machines
called men, he would not run out
of the round-house to-night. His
fall had given his foot a nasty
wrench.</p>

<p>Some engineers, to change the
simile, would have argued that the
engine was off the track, and that
therefore the train was not in running
condition; but Orville merely
changed engines. His own steam
having been cut off, he ordered an
automobile for twenty minutes to
seven; and after he had bathed and
bandaged his ankle he determined,
with a grit worthy of the cause that
brought it forth, to attend that dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
even if he paid for it in the
hospital, with Annette as special
nurse.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Nickerson, who lived
across the hall, had heard of his
misfortune, and called to proffer
his services.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I help you get to bed?&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not due in bed, Mr. Nickerson,
for many hours; but if you
will give me a few fingers of your
excellent old Scotch with the bouquet
of smoked herring, I will go
on dressing for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear boy,&#8221; said the old gentleman
almost tearfully, &#8220;it is impossible
for you to venture on your
foot with such a sprain. It is badly
swollen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Nickerson, my heart has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
received a worse wrench than my
foot has, therefore I go out to
dine.&#8221; At sound of which enigmatical
declaration Mr. Nickerson
hurried off for the old Scotch,
and in a few minutes Orville&#8217;s
faintness had passed off, and with
help from the amiable old man he
got into his evening clothes&mdash;with
the exception of his left foot, which
was encased in a flowered slipper of
sunset red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear Mr. Nickerson,
I&#8217;m a thousand times obliged to
you, and if I can get you to help
me hop downstairs I will wait for
the automobile on the front stoop.&#8221;
(Orville had been born in Brooklyn,
where they still have &#8220;stoops.&#8221;)
&#8220;I&#8217;m on time so far.&#8221;</p>

<p>But if Orville was on time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
automobile was not, the driver not
being a methodical man; and when
it did come, it was all the motor-man
could do to stop it. It seemed
restive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to shut off on the
oats,&#8221; said Orville gayly, from his
seat on the lowest step of the
&#8220;stoop.&#8221;</p>

<p>The picture of a gentleman in
immaculate evening clothes with
the exception of a somewhat rococo
carpet slipper, seemed to amuse
some street children who were passing.
If they could have followed
the &#8220;auto&#8221; they would have been
even more diverted, but such was
not to be their fortune. Mr. Nickerson
helped his friend into the
vehicle, and the driver started at
a lively rate for Fifth Avenue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Orville lived in Seventeenth
Street, near Fifth Avenue; Mrs.
Marten lived on Fifth Avenue,
near Fortieth Street. Thirty-eighth
Street and Thirty-ninth
Street were reached and passed
without further incident than the
fact that Orville&#8217;s ankle pained
him almost beyond the bearing-point;
but, as it is not the history
of a sprained ankle that I am writing,
if the vehicle had stopped at
Mrs. Marten&#8217;s my pen would not
have been set to paper.</p>

<p>But the motor-wagon did not
even pause. It kept on as if the
Harlem River were to be its next
stop.</p>

<p>Orville had stated the number of
his destination with distinctness,
and he now rang the annunciator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and asked the driver why he did
not stop.</p>

<p>Calmly, in the even tones that
clear-headed persons use when they
wish to inspire confidence, the
chauffeur said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be alarmed,
sir, but I can&#8217;t stop. There&#8217;s something
out of kilter, and I may have
to run some time before I can get
the hang of it. There&#8217;s no danger
as long as I can steer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you slacken up in
front of the house, so that I can
jump?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With that foot, sir? Impossible,
and, anyway, I can&#8217;t slacken
up. I think we&#8217;ll stop soon. I
don&#8217;t know when it was charged,
but a gentleman had it before I was
sent out with it. It won&#8217;t be long,
I think. I&#8217;ll run around the block,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and maybe I can stop the next
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orville groaned for a twofold
reason: his ankle was jumping with
pain, and he would lose the pleasure
of taking Miss Badeau in to
dinner, for it was a minute past
seven.</p>

<p>He sat and gazed at his carpet
slipper, and thought of the daintily
shod feet of the adorable Annette,
as the horseless carriage wound
around the block. As they approached
the house again, Orville
imagined that they were slackening
up, and he opened the door to be
ready. It was now three minutes
past seven, and dinner had begun
beyond a doubt. The driver saw
the door swing open, and said:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t jump, sir. I can&#8217;t stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
yet. I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a good
deal of run in the machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orville looked up at the brownstone
front of the house with an
agonized stare, as if he would pull
Mrs. Marten to the window by the
power of his eyes. But Mrs. Marten
was not in the habit of pressing
her nose against the pane in an
anxious search for tardy guests.
In fact, it may be asserted with
confidence that it is not a Fifth
Avenue custom.</p>

<p>At that moment the purée was
being served to Mrs. Marten&#8217;s
guests, and to pretty Annette Badeau,
who really looked disconsolate
with the vacant chair beside
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has happened to
Orville,&#8221; said Mrs. Marten, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
over her shoulder toward the
hall door, &#8220;for he is punctuality
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Joe Burton was a short,
red-faced little man, with black
mutton-chop whiskers of the style
of &#8217;76, and a way of looking in the
most cheerful manner upon the
dark side of things. &#8220;Dessay
he&#8217;s been run over,&#8221; said he choppily.
&#8220;Wonder anyone escapes.
Steam-, gasoline-, electric-, horseflesh-,
man-propelled juggernauts.
Ought to be prohibited.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette could not repress a shudder.
Her aunt saw it and said:
&#8220;Orville will never be run over.
He&#8217;s too wide-awake. But it is
very singular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have been detained by
an order for a story,&#8221; said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Marten, also with the amiable purpose
of consoling Annette, for both
of the Martens knew how she felt
toward Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s lying on the front
sidewalk, hit by a sign or bitten
by a dog. Dogs ought not to be
allowed in the city; they only add
to the dangers of metropolitan existence,&#8221;
jerked out Mr. Burton, in
blithe tones, totally unaware that
his remarks might worry Annette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! I wish you&#8217;d
send some one out to see, Aunt
Henrietta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Annette. Mr. Burton
is always an alarmist. But,
Marie, you might step to the front
door and look down the avenue.
Mr. Thornton is always so punctual
that it is peculiar.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Marie went to the front door
and looked down the street just as
Thornton, gesticulating wildly, disappeared
around the corner of Fortieth
Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why didn&#8217;t she come
sooner!&#8221; said he aloud to himself.
&#8220;At least they would know why
I&#8217;m late. And she&#8217;ll be gone before
I come round again. Was
there ever such luck? Oh for a
good old horse that could stop, a
dear old nag that would pause and
not go round and round like a
blamed carrousel! Say, driver,
isn&#8217;t there any way of stopping this
cursed thing? Can&#8217;t you run it
into a fence or a house? I&#8217;ll take
the risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> won&#8217;t, sir. These automobiles
are very powerful, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of them turned over a news-stand
not long since and upset the stove
in it, and nearly burned up the
newsman. But there&#8217;s a plenty of
time for it to stop. I don&#8217;t have to
hurry back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s lucky,&#8221; said Orville.
&#8220;I thought maybe you&#8217;d have to
leave me alone with the thing.
But, say, she may run all night.
Here I am due at a dinner. I&#8217;m
tired of riding. This is no way
to spend Christmas. Slacken up,
and I&#8217;ll jump when I get around
there again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t slacken
up, and she&#8217;s going ten miles an
hour. You&#8217;ll break your leg if
you jump, and then where&#8217;ll you
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might be on their sidewalk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and then you could ring their bell,
and they&#8217;d take me in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you suing the company
for damages? Oh, no, sir.
I&#8217;m sorry, but it can&#8217;t be helped.
The company won&#8217;t charge you for
the extra time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it will,&#8221;
said Thornton savagely, the more
so as his foot gave a twinge of pain
just then.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;There was no one in sight,
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Marie, when she
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably he had an order for
a story and got absorbed in it and
forgot us,&#8221; said Mr. Marten; but
this conjecture did not seem to suit
Annette, for it did not fit what she
knew of his character.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;Possibly he was dropped in
an elevator,&#8221; said Mr. Burton.
&#8220;Strain on elevators, particularly
these electrical ones, is tremendous.
Some of &#8217;em have got to drop.
And a dropping elevator is no respecter
of persons. You and I may
be in one when it drops. Probably
he was. Sure, I hope not,
but as he is known to be the soul
of punctuality, we must put forward
some accident to account for
his lateness. People aren&#8217;t always
killed in elevator accidents. Are
they, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Burton,&#8221; said his wife,
&#8220;I wish you would give your morbid
thoughts a rest. Don&#8217;t you see
that Annette is sensitive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sensitive&mdash;with some one dying
every minute? It&#8217;s merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
because she happens to know Orville
that his death would be unpleasant.
If a man in the Klondike
were to read of it in the paper he
wouldn&#8217;t remember it five minutes.
But I don&#8217;t say he was in an elevator.
Maybe some one sent him
an infernal machine for a Christmas
present. May have been blown up
in a manhole or jumped from his
window to avoid flames. Why,
there are a million ways to account
for his absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie had opened the parlor windows
a moment before, as the house
was warm, and now there came
the humming of a rapidly moving
automobile. Mingled with it they
heard distinctly, although faintly,
&#8220;Mr. Marten, here I go.&#8221;</p>

<p>It gave them all an uncanny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
feeling. The fish was left untouched,
and for a moment silence
reigned. Then Mr. Marten sprang
from the table and ran to the front
door. He got there just in time to
see an automobile dashing around
a corner and to hear a distinctly
articulated imprecation in the well-known
voice of Orville Thornton.</p>

<p>In evening clothes and bare-headed,
Mr. Marten ran to Fortieth
Street, and saw the vehicle approaching
Sixth Avenue, its occupant
still hurling strong language
upon the evening air. Mr. Marten
is something of a sprinter, although
he has passed the fifty mark, and
he resolved to solve the mystery.
But before he had covered a third
of the block in Fortieth Street he
saw that he could not hope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
overtake the runaway automobile,
so he turned and ran back to the
house, rightly surmising that the
driver would circle the block.</p>

<p>When he reached his own doorstep,
badly winded, he saw the
automobile coming full tilt up the
avenue from Thirty-ninth Street.</p>

<p>The rest of the diners were on
the steps. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s coming,&#8221;
he panted. &#8220;The driver must be
intoxicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later they were treated
to the spectacle of Orville, still
hurling imprecations as he wildly
gesticulated with both arms. Several
boys were trying to keep up
with the vehicle, but the pace was
too swift. No policeman had yet
discovered its rotary course.</p>

<p>As Orville came near the Marten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
mansion he cried &#8220;Ah-h-h!&#8221; in
the relieved tones of one who has
been falling for half an hour and at
last sees ground in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; shouted
Mr. Marten wonderingly, as the
carriage, instead of stopping, sped
along the roadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sprained foot. Can&#8217;t walk.
Auto out of order. Can&#8217;t stop.
Good-by till I come round again.
Awful hungry. Merry Christmas!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ha!&#8221; said Joe Burton. &#8220;I
told you that it was an accident.
Sprained his foot and lost power
over vehicle. I don&#8217;t see the connection,
but let us be thankful that
he isn&#8217;t under the wheels, with a
broken neck, or winding round and
round the axle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s to be done?&#8221; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Mrs. Marten. &#8220;He says he&#8217;s
hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what!&#8221; said Mr. Burton,
in his explosive way. &#8220;Put
some food on a plate, and when
the carriage comes round again I&#8217;ll
jump aboard, and he can eat as he
travels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He loves purée of celery,&#8221; said
Mrs. Marten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Put some in a
clean lard-pail or a milk-pail. Little
out of the ordinary, but so is
the accident, and he can&#8217;t help his
hunger. Hunger is no disgrace.
I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d ever eat soup
again, to tell the truth. I was
making up my mind whether a
wreath or a harp would be better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are so morbid, Mr.
Burton,&#8221; said his wife, while Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Marten told the maid to get a pail
and put some purée into it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">He dropped upon his bed, feeling white about the gills</p>

<p>When Thornton came around
again he met Mr. Marten near
Thirty-ninth Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door, Orville, and
Joe Burton will get aboard with
some soup. You must be starved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing like exercise
for getting up an appetite. I&#8217;ll be
ready for Burton,&#8221; said Orville,
&#8220;Awfully sorry I can&#8217;t stop and
talk; but I&#8217;ll see you again in a
minute or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door as he spoke,
and then, to the great delight of at
least a score of people who had
realized that the automobile was
running away, the rubicund and
stout Joe Burton, a pail of purée
in one hand and some table cutlery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and silverware and a napkin in the
other, made a dash at the vehicle,
and with help from Orville effected
an entrance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221; said Orville.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas! Awfully
sorry, old man, but it might be
worse. Better drink it out of the
pail. They gave me a knife and
fork, but they neglected to put in
a spoon or a dish. I thought that
you were probably killed, but I
never imagined this. Miss Badeau
was terribly worked up. I think
that she had decided on white carnations.
Nice girl. You could
easily jump, old man, if you
hadn&#8217;t sprained your foot. Hurt
much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like the devil; but I&#8217;m glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it worried Miss Badeau. No, I
don&#8217;t mean that. But you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; said Burton,
with a sociable smile. &#8220;Mrs. Marten
told me. Nice girl. Let her
in next time. Unusual thing, you
know. People are very apt to
jump <i>from</i> a runaway vehicle, but
it seldom takes up passengers. Let
her get in, and you can explain
matters to her. You see, she sails
early in the morning, and you
haven&#8217;t much time. You can tell
her what a nice fellow you are, you
know, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have
Mrs. Marten&#8217;s blessing. Here&#8217;s
where I get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>With an agility admirable in one
of his stoutness, Mr. Burton leaped
to the street and ran up the steps
to speak to Miss Badeau. Orville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
could see her blush, but there was
no time for her to become a passenger
that trip, and the young
man once more made the circuit of
the block, quite alone, but strangely
happy. He had never ridden with
Annette, except once on the elevated
road, and then both Mr. and Mrs.
Marten were of the company.</p>

<p>Round sped the motor, and when
the Martens&#8217; appeared in sight, Annette
was on the sidewalk with a
covered dish in her hand and a look
of excited expectancy on her face
that added a hundredfold to its
charms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are&mdash;only ten cents
a ride. Merry Christmas!&#8221; shouted
Orville gayly, and leaned half out
of the automobile to catch her. It
was a daring, almost an impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
jump, yet Annette made it without
accident, and, flushed and excited,
sat down in front of Mr. Thornton
without spilling her burden, which
proved to be sweetbreads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Badeau&mdash;Annette, I
hadn&#8217;t expected it to turn out this
way, but of course your aunt doesn&#8217;t
care, or she wouldn&#8217;t have let you
come. We&#8217;re really in no danger.
This driver has had more experience
dodging teams in this last
hour than he&#8217;d get in an ordinary
year. They tell me you&#8217;re going
to Europe early to-morrow to leave
all your friends. Now, I&#8217;ve something
very important to say to you
before you go. No, thanks, I don&#8217;t
want anything more. That purée
was very filling. I&#8217;ve sprained my
ankle, and I need to be very quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for a week or two, perhaps until
this machine runs down, but at the
end of that time would you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Orville hesitated, and Annette
blushed sweetly. She set the sweetbreads
down upon the seat beside
her. Orville had never looked so
handsome before to her eyes.</p>

<p>He hesitated. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you be willing to go to
Paris on a bridal trip?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette&#8217;s answer was drowned
in the hurrah of the driver as the
automobile, gradually slackening,
came to a full stop in front of the
Martens&#8217;.</p>

<p>But Orville read her lips, and as
he handed his untouched sweetbreads
to Mrs. Burton, and his
sweetheart to her uncle, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wore a seraphically happy expression;
and when Mr. Marten and
the driver helped him up the steps
at precisely eight o&#8217;clock, Annette&#8217;s
hand sought his, and it was a jolly
party that sat down to a big though
somewhat dried-up Rhode Island
turkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marriage also is an accident,&#8221;
said Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
